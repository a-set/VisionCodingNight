# VisionCodingNight
These are a list of simple Computer Vision tools that i am developing while learning computer vision. I am usually working past midnight on this stuff, if you were wondering ;)

#ColorQuantizer
The first one among them is a color quantizer. So we know that K-means sucks at Color Segmentation, so why not use it for
quantization instead. I am using the RGB color space itself. This could be done in L*a*b* workspace as well.
